# 🐳 Docker Learning Lab

Welcome! 👋  

This repository is designed as a **learning resource** to help you practice Docker and Docker Compose using real-world examples with databases, admin tools, and a simple Java application.  

Whether you are new to Docker or looking to reinforce your knowledge, this repo provides a guided path with hands-on exercises.  


## 📚 Learning Path

Follow the steps in order to gradually build your Docker skills:

1. **Start with the basics**  
   - [MySQL](./MySQL/README-mysql.md) 🗄️  
   Learn how to run a relational database in Docker and connect to it.  

2. **Explore PostgreSQL**  
   - [Postgres](./Postgres/README-posgres.md) 🗄️  
   Practice with initialization scripts, volumes, and configuration files.  

3. **Work with NoSQL**  
   - [Mongo](./Mongo/README-mongo.md) 🥭  
   - [Mongo Express](./MongoExpress/README-mongoexpress.md) 🥭  
      Run MongoDB and manage it through a web client.  

4. **Try Oracle**  
   - [Oracle](./Oracle/README-oracle.md) 🏛️  
   Experiment with a containerized Oracle database.  

5. **Add Administration Tools**  
   - [PHPMyAdmin](./PHPMyAdmin/README-phpmyadmin.md) 🖥️  
   Manage MySQL databases easily with a browser interface.  

6. **Run an Application in Docker**  
   - [Java](./Java/README-java.md) 🐧  
   Deploy a simple Java application inside a container.  

7. **Extra Tools**  
   - [Utils](./Utils/README-utils.md) 🧰
   Miscellaneous utilities and helper containers.  

## 🧩 Key Docker Concepts

Before diving in, let’s review a few basic terms:

- **Image** → A read-only template with instructions (like a mold).  
- **Container** → A running instance of an image (like an object created from the mold).  
- **Volume** → A persistent storage space that containers can use to save data.
